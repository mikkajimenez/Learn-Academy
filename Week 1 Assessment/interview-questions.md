# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: Git is a version control on your local machine. It can track source code history. It is open source and it is free!

  Researched answer: Git is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. 



2. What types of evaluations will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Relational operators (>, <, =, ...), equality operators (!==, ===, ==), logical operators (&&, ||)

  Researched answer: Boolean data type is primarily associated with conditional statements, which allow different actions by changing control flow depending on a condition evaluates to true or false. 



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: Index is the location of the element in a given value. A value is an element (can be number, string, boolean, etc.) in a variable. (ex. [a, b, c] ; index of value a is 0)

  Researched answer: Index is a read-only property; it contains the position of a regular expression match within a string. Javascript values are values like Booleans, Strings, Arrays, Numbers, etc.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: A repetition of execution of the code while the conditions are true

  Researched answer: Javascript loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code until a condition is met



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: Pair programming consists for two awesome people, the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the person who is coding and the Navigator guides the driver through the logic of the code

  Researched answer: Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. The driver writes the code and the navigator reviews each line of code as it is typed in.



6. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer: Git is still a bit challenging to me but the best practice I am learning from this week is LOOPing over the motions so it becomes a habit and it sticks to my memory. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. GitHub pull request: Pull requests tells other collaborators that you have made changes to your code and had pushed it into a branch allowing it to be reviewed for merging.

2. Higher Order Functions: Built-in functions that acts on arrays. It returns another function as an output

3. Jest: Jest is a Javascript testing framework. 

4. Objects: A data type that contains collections of key:value pairs

5. Classes: Blueprints of objects. Re-usable and customizable like functions
